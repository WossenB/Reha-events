## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run Reha-events locally on your machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WossenB/Reha-events.git
cd Reha-events
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Depending on the project setup, Reha-events likely uses either npm or yarn to manage dependencies. Look for a `package.json` file in the project root.

If you see a `package.json`, install dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Or yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

### 3. Start the Local Server

If the project uses a tool like [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), or another frontend framework, you can typically start the development server with:

```bash
npm start
```

Or:

```bash
yarn start
```

> If you don’t see a specific start script, check the `package.json` under the “scripts” section or consult additional documentation provided in the repo.

### 4. Open Application in Your Browser

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

or the port displayed in your terminal after running the start command.
